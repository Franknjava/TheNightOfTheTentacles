# TheNightOfTheTentacles
This repository contains the java source code for my tech talk: Frank'n Java ... and the night of the tentacles.

Basically there are two projects:

EvilTentaclesOfDeath contains the tentacle framework. This includes the Tentacle interface and the classes needed for the necessary bytecode manipulation.

SquishyTentacleFun contains usage examlpes of the tentacle framework.

So welcome to the cthulhuoid world of evil tentacles of death and have join my "Getting martyred".
