# TheNightOfTheTentacles
This repository contains the java source code for my tech talk: Frank'n Java ... and the night of the tentacles.

Basically there are two projects:

**EvilTentaclesOfDeath** contains the tentacle framework. This includes the Tentacle interface and the classes needed for the necessary bytecode manipulation.

**SquishyTentacleFun** contains usage examples of the tentacle framework.

So, welcome to the cthulhuoid world of evil tentacles of death and join my "Getting martyred".

## Getting martyred

... or follow me down the rabbithole into a world of cthulhuoid beauty.

1. You will need Maven to compile the projects. So, get and install it.
2. Download the two Maven projects from this repository. Even for the examples you will need both, because the framework is not available in any public Maven repository.
3. Build **EvilTentaclesOfDeath** first using "mvn clean install". Remember, it is not available in public repositories.
4. Now build **SquishyTentacleFun** using "mvn clean install". 

That's it. Now you can start the examples from **SquishyTentacleFun**. All examples have a **main** method which takes no arguments. The following examples are available:
